## Worst case scenario: temproal results

#### Comments : 

1- If nothing is done, according this modelisation (imperfect of course), we will finish  with 69% of the population removed. Thatâ€™s perfectly match with the worst case scenario proposed by the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html): 224 millions Americans can be infected by the virus vs 226 millions with this estimation.

2- With no exterior agent, the epidemic should stop a time 18, which represent 60% of the population removed. That's means, if 60% of our population is removed, the endemic state is over.



## Answer to the question: If a vaccine against CO-VID is found tomorrow, which vaccination strategy leads to the suppression of the endemic state for a lowest immunization rate ?

Comparaison strategies

#### Comments : 

1- Random immunisation is not an efficient strategy

2- Targeted the hubs of the networks are super efficient strategy, but implies that we know the graph (which is not true)

3- Acquitance strategy gives good results and this strategy is purely local, requiring minimal information about randomly selected nodes and their immediate environment.
